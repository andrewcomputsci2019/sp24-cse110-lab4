# Part two

## 1
line 12 will print the value of 3 as i was declared with the var keyword

## 2 
line 13 will print the value of 150, as that was the last value inside the discountedPrice variable, again no error is 
thrown as discountedPrice was declared with the var keyword

## 3
line 14 again will print the same thing as line 13, a value of 150 as the was the last value calculated from the loop.

## 4
The function discountedPrices will return a list with all values discounted by the margin given to the function rounded to the nearest cent, in this case the list/array returned is [ 50, 100, 150 ].

## 5
On line 12 an error will be thrown as no variable i is declared within scope as, the i in the loop was declared with the keyword let

## 6
on line 13 an error will be thrown as no variable discountedPrice is declared within scope, same reasoning as above

## 7
on line 14 the program will still print the value of 150, as final price was declared within the scope and preservers the last value calculated from the loop

## 8
The function still returns the same list from question 4 answer even with the variable declaration changes, as each modification of the discounted list was done legally.

## 9
Line 11 will throw an error as the variable i is not defined within scope

## 10
Line 12 will print the value of 3 as that is the length of the prices array

## 11
The function still returns the same list from before given this input, but a slight change from the code is fact the numbers are now longer rounded to the nearest cent, therefore leading to a slight change if outputs are fractional. No errors are thrown
