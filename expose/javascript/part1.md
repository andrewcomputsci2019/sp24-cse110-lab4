 1. what is printed by line 9? 
    1. What is printed on line 9 is the string "values added: 20", and no errors are thrown
 2. What is printed on line 13?
    1. What is printed on line 13 is the string "final result: 20", and no errors are thrown

## let declaration
 3. what is printed by line 9?
    1. "values added: 20" is printed on line 9, and no errors are thrown
 4. What is printed on line 13?
    1. Since result is declared with let, an error is printed as result is not defined within scope

## const declaration
